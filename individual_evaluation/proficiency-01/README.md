# Proficiency 01
This is my first proficiency exercise.

This exercise is to make sample app containing one screen that grabs 
the current time on mobile device (iOS) and diplays:
- "Good Morning" if the local time is between 05:45:00 and 11:59:59
- "Good afternoon" if the local time is between 12:00:00 and 17:59:59
- "Good evening" if the local time is between 18:00:00 and 05:44:59 (+1)
