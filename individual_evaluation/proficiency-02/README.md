In this exercise, I creates a new application containing one screen that
functions as a basic calculator with buttons and a display.

- If the amount of characters in your username is even, display only even number buttons. Else, display
only odd number buttons in your calculator.
- If your username starts with the letters A through M, include buttons (and functionality) for addition and
division. Else, include buttons (and functionality) for subtraction and multiplication.
- Include a display where the user can see what has been calculated.
- Include a clear button.
